# Conclusions ðŸ’¡
Answering four questions about the dataset

## Questions asked ðŸ¤”:
### _**Question 1**_: Are more unique car models using alternative fuels in 2018 compared to 2008? By how much?
In 2008 we had 984 unique car models using gasoline, we had also one car model for ethanol, CNG and gas respectively. However, in 2018 we have 749 unique models which its fuel is gasoline and _**26**_ unique models for Gas, _**26**_ unique models for Ethanol, _**19**_ for Diesel and _**12**_ Unique Models for Electric Cars

In terms of proportions, we can see a big change in the manufacture of Cars using alternative fuels. It has increased from _**0.53%**_ in 2008 to _**7.3%**_ which would be an increment of _**1284.62%**_ in 10 years.

### Correlation between _**Greenhouse Gas Score**_ and _**Miles per Galon**_ from 2008 to 2018: 
However, when analyzing the relationship between this two variables, we can see that there is a _**strong positive relationship**_ between this two variables.
